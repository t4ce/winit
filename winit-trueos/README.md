# TRUEOS UI4 backend

This crate supplies Winit's `target_os = "trueos"` platform backend. It maps
top-level Winit windows to broker-owned UI4 visual frames.

The backend uses the versioned UI4 keyboard stream and preserves physical USB
HID usages, press/release state, modifiers, and device-loss resets. Window
visibility, hit testing, opacity, and title metadata use the versioned window
state ABI. Escape is delivered to the Winit application rather than closing a
frame in the host.

UI4 owns presentation. Raw-window-handle exposes a host-issued UI4 graphics
connection and a generation-bearing visual-frame ID; neither is an X11,
Wayland, or output handle. OpenGL and Glutin surface creation remain
unavailable until a TRUEOS graphics backend consumes those handles. UI4 stores
title metadata, but does not render title bars.

Run the backend checks without inheriting a parent Blueprint Cargo config:

```sh
cd /tmp
cargo test --manifest-path /home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Blueprints/vendor/winit/Cargo.toml -p winit-trueos
cargo check --manifest-path /home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Blueprints/vendor/winit/Cargo.toml -p winit-trueos
```

The full facade is selected for the Blueprint application target. The archived
TRUEOS standard library builds successfully. Use the Blueprint builder's
vendored `libc` overlay for this target. The raw check below still reaches the
archived toolchain's `restricted_std` gate in ordinary `std` consumers; it is
not a Winit backend error:

```sh
cd /tmp
RUSTC=/home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Rust-Toolchain-nightly-2026-07-10/bin/rustc \
  /home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Rust-Toolchain-nightly-2026-07-10/bin/cargo \
  -Zbuild-std=std,panic_abort -Zjson-target-spec check \
  --config 'patch.crates-io.libc.path="/home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Blueprints/vendor/libc-0.2.186"' \
  --manifest-path /home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Blueprints/vendor/winit/Cargo.toml \
  -p winit --no-default-features --features serde \
  --target /home/t4ce/Repos/TRUEOS-Blueprints/apps/target.json
```

This backend targets Winit 0.31. It does not make applications built against
the distinct Winit 0.30 API, including the current Alacritty checkout, source
compatible by itself.

## Input and multiple combos

The existing Winit callback API remains unchanged. UI4 routes window keyboard,
pointer (including tablet/eye-tracker positions), wheel, and pan events. All
keyboard/pointer/pan events now carry process-local `DeviceId`s; resolve them
with `winit::platform::trueos::device_source(id)` to recover the full controller,
slot, endpoint and device kind. IDs are not combo IDs, and rebinding a combo does
not change endpoint identity. Keyboard modifiers are the union of the keyboards
active in that window. Device-loss releases retain their originating device ID.

`listen_device_events` supports `Always`, `WhenFocused` (default), and `Never`.
Independent host sequence readers deliver physical keyboard keys, wheel,
buttons, and explicitly supplied relative cursor reports to `device_event`.
Mouse motion uses the signed relative report even at desktop edges; absolute
coordinates are never misreported as raw motion. Readers discard the initial
backlog and process at most 256 records per stream per iteration. Queue loss
logs a warning and releases tracked held inputs. Absolute-only pointing devices
remain available through window events and the native interface.

Enable native routed records on each window where needed:

```rust,ignore
use winit::platform::trueos::{InputEvent, WindowExtTrueOS};

window.trueos_capture_input(true);
// In about_to_wait, or after a standard window input callback:
let batch = window.trueos_take_input();
if batch.dropped != 0 {
    // Reset application held state and resample the native HID state.
}
for event in batch.events {
    let device = event.device_id();
    match event {
        InputEvent::Pointer(pointer) => {
            // pointer.combo_id, pointer.vcursor, dx/dy, buttons_down,
            // buttons_pressed/released, local and desktop coordinates.
        }
        InputEvent::Keyboard(key) => {
            // Endpoint identity, HID usage (kind 4), text, modifiers,
            // sequences, repeat and device-loss (kind 3).
        }
        InputEvent::Pan(pan) => {
            // Combo identity, endpoint and begin/update/end deltas.
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

Capture is opt-in, bounded to 1024 records per window, with an explicit loss
counter. It does not consume standard events. Records follow backend drain
order (keyboard, pointer, pan), not a shared hardware timestamp order. UI4's
keyboard ABI has no combo ID; match its endpoint against the keyboard member
of `hid::input_combos()` when a persona is needed.

On TRUEOS, `winit::platform::trueos::hid` exposes the platform's VLayer input
API directly, using its canonical types rather than a second ABI copy:

- `InputCombo::request`, member binding, color, refresh and removal;
  `input_combos()` enumerates physical/virtual collections.
- `hid_hut_mice/keyboards/tablets()` discover endpoints and current state.
- `hid_tablet_read()` preserves tablet data (including pressure) not represented
  by ordinary Winit pointer events; `midi_read_v1()` has an independent sequence
  cursor and explicit loss count.
- `VCursor`, `VKeyboard`, and `VGamepad` request virtual devices, submit commands,
  and release capabilities on drop. `VGamepad::snapshot()` exposes virtual
  gamepad state. Physical gamepad samples are not currently exposed by VLayer.

For example, create one independently controlled persona; repeat for N personas:

```rust,ignore
use winit::platform::trueos::hid::{InputCombo, InputComboSourceKind, VCursor, VKeyboard};

let cursor = VCursor::request("player cursor")?;
let keyboard = VKeyboard::request("player keyboard")?;
let combo = InputCombo::request("player", InputComboSourceKind::Human, None)?;
combo.bind_cursor(&cursor)?;
combo.bind_keyboard(&keyboard)?;
// Keep cursor/keyboard alive; submit through their capability-backed methods.
// Bind a tablet endpoint and gamepad independently when available.
// Removing a combo removes its identity, not its member devices.
```

One combo holds at most one device of each supported class, matching VLayer's
contract. Multiple combos work concurrently; they are not collapsed into a
single synthetic keyboard or cursor. MIDI and tablet details stay in the native
interface because Winit has no standard MIDI/gamepad/pressure event equivalent.
The native namespace follows the platform VLayer API; standard Winit types and
callbacks retain their existing signatures.
